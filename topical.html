      <h2>Fake news amd critical thinking in the digital era</h2>
      <p>Merriam-Webster defines fake as something that is <q>not true, real, or genuine</q><sup><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fake">[10]</a></sup></p>
      <p>And I would define fake news as being information that is indeed false or misleading, but <br> real. Its most defining characteristic is emotional exploitation.</p>
