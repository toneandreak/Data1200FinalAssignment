        Merriam-Webster defines fake as something that is <q>not true, real, or genuine</q> <sup><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fake">[1]</a></sup>. <!--All sources are linked this way-->
        And I would define fake news as being information that is indeed false or misleading, but
        real. Its most defining characteristic is emotional exploitation. Fake news seeks to go viral by triggering us with fear, anger or joy, and to go viral, you must be prominent on social media, but why? 
        On social media we can exclusively choose who we want to interact with.
        Thus, creating communities with people that very likely have harmonious views, ideas and interests with ourselves.
        People we can more easily identify with than others, and likewise also trust.

        <br> <br>
        An excellent recipe for going viral with a fake news story is indulging in a community’s interest and falsely encourage their dreams or nightmares.
        In mid-2016 close to the us elections, journalist <i>Craig Silverman</i> <sup><a href="https://www.craigsilverman.ca/">[2]</a></sup> 
        discovered that teenagers from a small city in Macedonia earned money by sharing fake news on Facebook that were pro-Trump and anti-Hillary
        <sup><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo#.op95xv35M">[3]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-42724320">[4]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Facebook">[5]</a></sup>.
        Whenever people clicked on the shared Facebook links to their fake news stories, they got redirected to a webpage with the full article, 
        on the same webpage the teenager’s earned money by collecting ad revenue. With Silverman’s discovery in mind, a more engaging and fitting definition of “Fake News” would be to disseminate or mislead information for your own benefit.
        I believe it is easier to change external commercial challenges related to dissemination of fake news, 
        rather than internal cognitive biases and emotions the user experience as a recipient of fake news.

        <br> <br>

        It might be a political utopia to extinguish challenges like the click-based economy.
        <sup><a href="https://readwrite.com/2021/02/08/the-click-economy-is-there-a-future/">[6]</a></sup>
        The American newspaper industry for instance relies heavily on digital ad revenue, 
        <q>Digital advertising accounted for 39% of newspaper advertising revenue in 2020</q> <sup><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/newspapers/">[7]</a></sup>.
        But perhaps we can learn from Norway. Norway has recently passed a law that requires content creators to disclose when they have retouched 
        or added a filter to photos on social media
        <sup><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1157704583/norway-passes-law-requiring-influencers-to-label-retouched-photos-on-social-media">[8]</a></sup>.
        Perhaps social media users would be wearier of what they click on if a news article was labeled with: Attention! contains ad revenue per click. 
        The allure of a sensational headline motivated by ad revenue may seem less tempting to click on if labeled with a warning. 
        Subsequently may it force News media to think of other ways to finance their operations.

        <br> <br>

        Regardless of ad revenue labeling, tabloid <sup><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tabloid">[9]</a></sup>
        news excels at triggering our emotions, making it painfully difficult to abstain from sensational headlines. 
        Though studies have found that it is possible to recognize clickbait <sup><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clickbait">[10]</a></sup>
        by looking at linguistical patterns
        <sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283721117_Misleading_Online_Content_Recognizing_Clickbait_as_False_News">[11]</a></sup>.
        Hopefully this can help bring forth artificial intelligence in the future that can assist us in becoming less vulnerable to emotional manipulation.
