        <h2 class = reflectionSubheading> Becoming a student </h2>
      
        <br>

        <p class = reflectionParagraph>It has been a challenge to go from being a pupil in high school to becoming a 
          student at university, but it has been a challenge that has had both ups and 
          downs. Being expected to go from a teenager to an adult in the long time of a 
          3-month summer break, is easier said than done. In the beginning it was very 
          abrupt and unusual, to go from one day being able to rely on the teachers to 
          tell you what to do, when to do it and how to do it in high school, to the 
          next day having to rely on yourself, you had to find out what you needed to 
          do, you had to research and learn on your own and you had to teach yourself how to set yourself up for success in the courses. 
          <br>
          <br>
          As the student life started, it didnâ€™t take too long before doing all this 
          individual learning and being responsible for your own knowledge, all became 
          second nature and easier to keep track of, and that is when all the fun things 
          started to happen. A couple positive aspects about student life compared to the 
          life back in high school is that you will meet a lot of likeminded people, some 
          may be older, some may be younger, but you all have something in common, you all 
          chose to go to university and most likely you all chose the course you are in due 
          to having an interest in it. This has led to fun group work, joining extracurricular 
          school activities and engaging more with the city that we all study in. 

         <br>
         <br>
      
          Although it has sometimes been hard to get used to becoming a student at times, it 
          has taught me so much about responsibility, accountability, and maturity towards 
          myself and others, which are things that I will carry with me forever. Hence, I am 
          grateful for this transition from pupil to student and can`t wait for the next transition 
          from student to work.

        <h2 class = reflectionSubheading> Learning to code </h2>

        <p class = reflectionParagraph> Coding is something which I have always found to be super cool and 
          interesting, and I have always thought that it is super difficult and 
          that you need to be a genius in order to understand any of it. However, 
          after starting classes in both html and css programing, as well as 
          Javascript, it has opened my eyes to the fact that anyone who wishes can 
          learn to code, although it might seem difficult and super complex at times, 
          most of the time you can just go through the course modules or find a nice 
          video on youtube that explains everything. Therefore, it has been an 
          amazing experience to start to learn coding, although I am still very much 
          a beginner, I feel like if I just continue to work on it and fine tune my 
          knowledge, I can become just as good as all these people that I have seen 
          in the movies. 

          <br>
          <br>

          Learning coding has also taught me a lot about technology that I had not 
          thought about before, such as the ability to make videogames and understand 
          how they work and what attributes allow them to do that, the way a menu on 
          a tv or app is set up and so much more. All in all this knowledge in programming 
          that I will be gaining over the coming years will be something which I will have 
          use for no matter what line of work or further studies I do, and it is an area 
          where there are always new things coming and more and more resource availability 
          to help along the process.

a) learning to code, or
b) being a student rather than a pupil, or
c) managing the workload.
