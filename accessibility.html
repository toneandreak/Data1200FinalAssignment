<!--Accessibility page: It must contain a short presentation of accessibility
(up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
accessibility using an automated test. Also explain how you checked,
validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the
testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of
your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we
are certain to read. (Grammar not important.)
The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an
automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you
reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire
site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts
without a common theme?-->
