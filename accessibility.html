        <p class="accessibilityParagraph">We kept accessibility foremost in our thoughts from when we first started to build the website.
        We wanted to make sure that anyone would be able to use and enjoy it, which was why we not
         only focused on “passing” the accessibility checker, but also on other aspects of accessibility
         as well. We thought about the color choice and how it would impact readability for those with
         visual impairments, as well as language use for those with different reading disabilities, 
         cognitive disabilities and learning difficulties. Instead of thinking along the lines of
        “catering” to those with disabilities, as it is often phrased, we have decided to build our
         website with the mindset that we are building without actively including barriers instead.

        <p class="accessibilityParagraph">
          We ran our website through the accessibility checker several times while we were working on it to make sure that we 
          wouldn’t have to go back and fix things when we were “done” but could make sure everything was done correctly from the get-go.
           Starting from the very beginning, where we didn’t have a title, as shown in the picture here. As we went along, more problems 
           cropped up, such as us using an h3 header under an h1 header. 
          We didn’t have any problems with color contrast, because we had chosen an accessible color scheme beforehand.

<!--Accessibility page: It must contain a short presentation of accessibility
(up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
accessibility using an automated test. Also explain how you checked,
validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the
testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of
your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we
are certain to read. (Grammar not important.)
The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an
automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you
reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire
site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts
without a common theme?-->
