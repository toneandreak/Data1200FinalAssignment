          <p class="accessibilityParagraph">We kept accessibility foremost in our thoughts from when we first started to build the website.
        We wanted to make sure that anyone would be able to use and enjoy it, which was why we not
         only focused on “passing” the accessibility checker, but also on other aspects of accessibility
         as well. We thought about the color choice and how it would impact readability for those with
         visual impairments, as well as language use for those with different reading disabilities, 
         cognitive disabilities and learning difficulties. Instead of thinking along the lines of
        “catering” to those with disabilities, as it is often phrased, we have decided to build our
         website with the mindset that we are building without actively including barriers instead. Because of this, we decided 
         that the Fun page should be accessible as well, not just the other pages.

          We ran our website through the accessibility checker from Achecker at continously while we were working on it to make sure that we 
          wouldn’t have to go back and fix things when we were “done” but could make sure everything was done correctly from the get-go. In addition, we
          made decisions beforehand, such as limiting our use of the div class, to make the website more accessible.
          Starting from the very beginning, where we didn’t have a title, as shown in the picture here. As we went along, more problems 
          cropped up, such as us using an h3 header under an h1 header, but these were the only two accessibility problems the accessibility checker showed that we had.
          We didn’t have any problems with color contrast, because we had chosen an accessible color scheme beforehand. When we had considered ourselves finished, we had 0
          known problems and 0 likely problems. We managed to reduce our potential problems from 31 to 26 in accordance with the WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) guidelines.

The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an
automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you
reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire
site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts
without a common theme?-->
