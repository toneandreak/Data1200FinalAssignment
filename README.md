# Data1200FinalAssignment
This is the final assignment for our group for the course DATA1200 Webdevelopment at OsloMet.
Some information about the commments in the code: the comments that the files have in common (except the fun page), is put mainly in the index.html file to avoid repetitive comments in the files. On the other pages, we have commented sections on the page that is not recurrent in the index.html file.
