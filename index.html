          As first year students we have had a lot of fun, but we have also had to work hard.
          The course DATA1200 Webdevelopment has taught us about building websites, programming, accessibility and technology.
          This first semester has been challenging, due to corona restrictions that still affects the daily university life. 
          This includes digital lectures and exams. For this assignment we all had to come together and use our different strengths.
          The group consists of students from Applied Computer Science and Software Engineering, where the Computer Science students 
          have more knowledge about website design and the Software Engineering students have a more technical approach.
          This website includes an reflection essay about learning to code, a short presentation of accesability of this website, 
          a topical information site about fake news and critical thinking in the digital era and a fun page about Lilo, the cat.
